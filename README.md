# Credit-EDA-Case-Study

## Introduction

Learning how to apply EDA in real business scenario and understanding how it helps to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services, how to use data to reduce the losses.

### Business understanding:

Because of insufficient or non-existent credit history, the loan providing companies find it difficult to approve loans. Some customers take advantage by becoming defaulter as a result loan providing companies face losses. So EDA is used to analyse the patterns present in the data and ensures that customers capable of loan repayment are not rejected. When loan application is received by a company/bank, two types of risks are associated with the decision made by bank:

        1. Applicant likely to repay loan- application rejected- loss of business. 

        2. Applicant not likely to repay loan- application approved- loss of business.

The data given contains two scenarios:

        1.The client with payment difficulties

        2.All other cases

When a client applies for a loan: four types of decisions could be taken:

                       1.Approved
                       
                       2.Cancelled
                       
                       3.Refused
                       
                       4.Unused offer

### Business Objectives

The case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying loan which may be used for taking actions like Approving the loan, rejecting the loan etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of loan repayment are not rejected.

This dataset has 3 files as explained below:

        1.'application_data.csv': contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.

        2.'previous_application.csv': contains information about the clientâ€™s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.

        3.'columns_description.csv': is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.
